# Eat a Burger App

# Overview
This app stores the burger that a user inputs, and displays that burger with a button that says, "Eat Me!".  When the user clicks eat me, the burger will move over to the right, and will be displayed as "eaten".  All burgers will remain stored in a database, whether they've been eaten or not.
